# Fluter Crash Course

- Native building apps for mobile, web and desktop
- You can build very performant iOS and Android native appts with only one code base, other than like an app that uses javascript or kotlin, or swift codebase
- Cross-platform building (if you will build for iOS, use a Mac)
- Flutter is generally faster than javascript compiling apps

## Programming language

- OOP (Object-Oriented Language) Language - Dart
- Similar to Javascript with elements of Java

## Widget

- Everything is a widget
- It's similar to react, instead of components, you use widgets, and each widget has a build method that can be overwritten

### Stateless widgets

- The state can't be changed during runtime of the app (example using @override on build method)

### Stateful Widgets

- Mutable state that can be redrawn on the screen multiple times (example using @override on createState method)

## Requirements

- iOS: Latest Xcode & iOS Simulator (on a Mac)
- Android: Android Studio (Windows) / SDK / EMULATOR (ADV)
- Android Studio Plugin (Flutter Plugin)
- VSCode Extensions (Flutter extension)
